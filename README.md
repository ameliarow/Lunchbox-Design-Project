# DECO3500 Project: Lunch Thyme
## Amelia Rowhani | Group Open

The following repository contains process documentation and design work that led to the design and development of the _Lunch Thyme_ family lunchbox planning system prototype. Process documentation contains thorough details regarding _Lunch Thyme's_ design and prototype iterations, research and user evaluations, and illustrates all key stages of the project's design process.

### Proof-of-Concept Prototype
Please access the _Lunch Thyme_ final prototype by navigating to the following link: [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/5bUEyqgucY6Yy9biadGwgS/Lunchbox-Project-HighFi?node-id=28%3A5093&scaling=scale-down&page-id=28%3A5092&starting-point-node-id=28%3A5093)

Please find the _Lunch Thyme_ prototype design file here: [File](https://www.figma.com/file/5bUEyqgucY6Yy9biadGwgS/Lunchbox-Project-HighFi?node-id=28%3A5092)

To deploy and use the _Lunch Thyme_ prototype, please navigate to the above prototype link and begin interactions. Please note, a selected array of interactions are supported at this stage, guided by an example family scenario. To ensure all features can be engaged with, please find and refer to the prototype task flow and scenario guide here: [Task Flow](https://github.com/ameliarow/Lunchbox-Design-Project/blob/main/Final%20Prototype%20Resources/Lunch%20Thyme%20Prototype%20Task%20Flow%20(1).pdf).
